# Automating investing platform

> Tried automating the process of investment in one of the [unreliable] platform.  
> After creation of account, you'll be provided 180 INR for investment, I'll use those 180 INR only for investment.  
> It is claimed that choosing 5-5 matches will win you the bet & it's 100% confirmed.

## Features 

> 1. Login automated with multiple accounts.  
> 2. Automated the investment method, including chosing team and money selection.

## Folder structure

> 1. [variables](assets/variables.py) represents all the variable values of this project.
> 2. [xpaths](assets/xpaths.py) represents all the xpaths used for this project.  
> 3. [methods](assets/methods.py) represents all the methods used to do the repitetive tasks in this project.  
> 4. [main_account](accounts_betting/main_account.py) represents the main or the master account which holds the maximum value of profitable money/income in this investment portal.  
> 5. [person1_account](accounts_betting/person1_account.py) represents the demo person's account whom the master account has referred and has li'l less profitable income.

## Future progress

> 1. Trying to automate signup process too.  
> 2. Trying to run this multiple times for every user.  
> 3. Will add a dashboard like and add options to do multiple tasks in it.  
> 4. Process of referral is still pending, will be added too.
